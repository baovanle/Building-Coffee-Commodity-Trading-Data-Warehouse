The two main types of coffee are Arabica and Robusta.
Global production of coffee is measured in jute bags, which hold 60kg of coffee [1].

There are a number of ways investors can trade coffee using the CMC Markets CFD Trading platform:

Coffee futures: a standard futures contract is the most common way people trade coffee. This is where investors agree to exchange a quantity of coffee with another party at a predetermined future date and price. 
Coffee futures can make wide swings within each trading day.

Coffee options: some people prefer options in this market because they can give them a bit more of a buffer against price volatility. With options, unlike futures, the holder doesn't have to buy or sell the asset 
if they don't wish to.

Coffee ETFs: an ETF is an investment fund that directly tracks the performance of the coffee market and can be bought and sold on a securities exchange. It can give an investor exposure to coffee futures without 
the need for a more complicated futures account.

Coffee company stocks: Investors can also invest in a coffee company, such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Dunkin' (DNKN). Meanwhile, Sara Lee, Procter & Gamble, Nestle and Kraft buy almost 50 percent of all coffee produced 
worldwide.

In this project, we only focus on Coffee futures trading data.
